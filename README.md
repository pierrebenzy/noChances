### Details
This is a README for our final project in the course CS65 - Smartphone Programming.

This document will contain information about high-level code management, known issues and instructions about how to download, install and use the app.

### Progress
1. DAY 1: Set-up gitlab. Official start of coding. Setting up git.Testing
2. DAY 2: Themis: Set up MapActivity. Experimenting with permissions. Hard to make everything run smoothly.
3. DAY 3: Themis: Made permissions work. **Now, when the user selects "Don't show again" when prompted by the location permissions, they are presented with a dialog which points them to the Settings so that they can set the permissions manually**.
