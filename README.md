# NoChances README

### TEAM
Pierre Desvallons, Haris Themistoklis

### Details
This is a README for our final project in the course CS65 - Smartphone Programming.

This document will contain information about high-level code management, known issues and instructions about how to download, install and use the app.

### Progress
1. DAY 1: Set-up gitlab. Official start of coding. Setting up git.Testing
2. DAY 2: Themis: Set up MapActivity. Experimenting with permissions. Hard to make everything run smoothly.
3. DAY 3: Themis: Made permissions work. **Now, when the user selects "Don't show again" when prompted by the location permissions, they are presented with a dialog which points them to the Settings so that they can set the permissions manually**.
4.- DAY 4: Pierre: commited work done on Saturday and sunday. Sign in and register work (except for the permissions does not work perfectly) Settings mostly done but some bugs are left to fix. I have started the list activity and found a way to add the color picker thing I will start this afternoon and I hope I'll be done with that tonight or tomorrow.
